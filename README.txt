'Batch' stands for '.bat'

!! PLEASE INSPECT THE BATCH SCRIPTS BEFORE EXECUTING THEM, NEVER RUN SOMEONE ELSE'S CODE WITHOUT FIRST VERIFYING IT !!
To inspect a batch script, right click it and press "Edit".

-- Originates from me (y'know, that guy!) --
The purpose of this script is to replace Roblox's current death sound with the related sound file called "ouch(.ogg)"
Default replacement is the "oof" sound, if you want to change it; then remove the sound and replace it with a file of the same name and format (.ogg)
Note: Roblox's death sound goes to default every time Roblox updates, you'll need to run the script every time that happens
(this may seem inconvenient -- which it is -- but it's better than manually copy and pasting the file)

!! The darn thing won't work if any file-names are changed, so make sure all names are the same way they used to be !!

To run the script, simply double-left click the "Replace" batch file, or right click then press "Open".

How it works:

The script (Replace.bat) checks your Start Menu (which holds all the programs that appear when you hit the Windows key)
for the "Roblox Player" shortcut, which it then follows Roblox into its main program files, so it can then swap the old
sound with the new one that you put in the main folder*!

*Main folder is the thingy that holds the script, this message, and the audio file.


Any more questions or suggestions? Please conta- oh wow, twenty dollars!
